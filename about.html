		About Tokyo
		</h1> 
		<p>Tokyo (/ˈtoʊkioʊ/ TOH-kee-oh, /-kjoʊ/ -⁠kyoh; Japanese: 東京, Tōkyō [toːkʲoː] (About this soundlisten)), officially the Tokyo Metropolis (Japanese: 東京都, Tōkyō-to), is the de facto capital[note 1][7] and most populous prefecture of Japan. Located at the head of Tokyo Bay, the prefecture forms part of the Kantō region on the central Pacific coast of Japan's main island of Honshu. Tokyo is the political and economic center of the country, as well as the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the national government. As of 2021, the prefecture has an estimated population of 13,960,236.[4] The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.393 million residents as of 2020.[5]

		Originally a fishing village, named Edo, the city became a prominent political center in 1603, when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo was one of the most populous cities in the world at over one million. Following the end of the shogunate in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to the city, which was renamed Tokyo (literally "eastern capital"). Tokyo was devastated by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, and again by Allied bombing raids during World War II. Beginning in the 1950s, the city underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion, going on to lead Japan's post-war economic recovery. Since 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's 23 special wards (formerly Tokyo City), various bed towns in the western area, and two outlying island chains.

		Tokyo is the largest urban economy in the world by gross domestic product, and is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Part of an industrial region that includes the cities of Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba, Tokyo is Japan's leading center of business and finance. In 2019, it hosted 36 of the Fortune Global 500 companies.[8] In 2020, it ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index, behind New York City, London, and Shanghai.[9] Tokyo has the world's tallest tower Tokyo Skytree[10] and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility MAOUDC.[11] The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia (1927).[12]

		The city has hosted multiple international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and three G7 Summits (1979, 1986, and 1993); it will also host the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were ultimately postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tokyo is an international center of research and development and is represented by several major universities, notably the University of Tokyo. Tokyo Station is the central hub for Japan's Shinkansen bullet train system, and the city is served by an extensive network of rail and subways. Notable districts of Tokyo include Chiyoda (the site of the Imperial Palace), Shinjuku (the city's administrative center), and Shibuya (a commercial, cultural and business hub).</p>

		Tokyo's History
		</h1>
		<p>Pre-1869 (Edo period)

		Tokyo was originally a small fishing village, Edo, in what was formerly part of the old Musashi Province. Edo was first fortified by
		the Edo clan, in the late twelfth century. In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved from Mikawa Province 
		(his lifelong base) to the Kantō region. When he became shōgun in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent Edo period,
		Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.[17] But Edo was still the home
		of the Tokugawa shogunate and not the capital of Japan (the Emperor himself lived in Kyoto from 794 to 1868).[18] During the Edo era, the city 
		enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the Pax Tokugawa, and in the presence of such peace, Edo adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, 
		which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city.[19] The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote
		the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued 
		the city. However, this prolonged period of seclusion came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853. Commodore 
		Perry forced the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate, leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe
		rise in inflation.[20] Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially
		in the form of the "smashing" of rice establishments.[21] Meanwhile, supporters of the Meiji Emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread 
		rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last Tokugawa shōgun, Yoshinobu, in 1867.[22] After 265 years,
		the Pax Tokugawa came to an end.</p>

		<p>In 1869, the 17-year-old Emperor Meiji moved to Edo, and in accordance, the city was renamed Tokyo (meaning Eastern Capital). 
		The city was divided into Yamanote and Shitamachi. Tokyo was already the nation's political and cultural center,[23] and the emperor's 
		residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well, with the former Edo Castle becoming the Imperial Palace. The city of Tokyo was 
		officially established on May 1, 1889.
		The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line portion between Ueno and Asakusa was the first subway line built in Japan and East Asia completed on December 
		30, 1927.[12] Central Tokyo, like Osaka, has been designed since about 1900 to be centered on major railway stations in a high-density 
		fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own right-of-way. Though expressways have been 
		built in Tokyo, the basic design has not changed.
		Tokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century: the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which left 140,000 dead or missing;
		and World War II</p>

		<figcaption align="center">Fig.2 - The Kidai Shōran Scroll: Tokyo Street Life in the Edo Period.</figcaption>
		
		<p>In 1943 , the city of Tokyo merged with the prefecture of Tokyo to form the "Metropolitan Prefecture" of Tokyo. 
		Since then, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government served as both the prefecture government for Tokyo, as well as administering the special
		wards of Tokyo, for what had previously been Tokyo City. World War II wreaked widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent 
		Allied air raids on Japan and the use of incendiary bombs. The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 
		75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed.[25] The deadliest night of the war came on March 9–10, 1945,
		the night of the American "Operation Meetinghouse" raid;[26] as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern half of the city,
		mainly in heavily residential wards. Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were demolished, 100,000 
		civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured.[27][28] Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Japan's capital city dwindled from 
		6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, with the majority of those who lost their homes living in "ramshackle, makeshift huts"</p>

		After the war, Tokyo became the base from which the United States under Douglas MacArthur administered Japan for six years. Tokyo struggled 
		to rebuild as occupation authorities stepped in and drastically cut back on Japanese government rebuilding programs, focusing instead on 
		simply improving roads and transportation. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until the 1950s.[30]
		
		After the occupation of Japan ended in 1952, Tokyo was completely rebuilt and was showcased to the world during the 1964 Summer Olympics. The 1970s 
		brought new high-rise developments. In 1978, Sunshine 60—the tallest skyscraper in Asia until 1985[31]—and Narita International Airport were constructed, 
		and the population increased to about 11 million in the metropolitan area.[32] The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum has historic Japanese 
		buildings that existed in the urban landscape of pre-war Tokyo.

		Tokyo's subway and commuter rail network became one of the busiest in the world[33] as more and more people moved to the area. In the 1980s,
		real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals 
		were caught with mortgage-backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan's "Lost Decade",
		[34] from which it is now slowly recovering.

		Tokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tennōzu Isle, Shiodome, 
		Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (now also a Shinkansen station), and the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. Buildings of significance have been demolished 
		for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as Omotesando Hills.[35]

		Land reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and
		 entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed[36] for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals
		 in other regions of Japan, to slow down rapid development in Tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans 
		 have been controversial[37] within Japan and have yet to be realized.

		The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu was felt in Tokyo. However, due to Tokyo's 
		earthquake-resistant infrastructure, damage in Tokyo was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami,[38] although activity in
		 the city was largely halted.[39] The subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left Tokyo unaffected, despite occasional 
		 spikes in radiation levels.[40][41] In 2015, the tap water radioactivity was still higher in Tokyo compared to other cities in Japan.[42]

		On September 7, 2013, the IOC selected Tokyo to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Tokyo was supposed to be the first Asian city to host the Olympic 
		Games twice.[43] However, due to the global outbreak and economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Summer Olympics games were ultimately 
		postponed to 2021 and it is unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives 
		approaches to tackle the most urgent problems.[44]

		Geography and Government
		</h1>
		<p>
		The mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi)
		north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft).[45] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west,
		Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) 
		and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern 
		than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41) and New York City (40.71).[46]

		Also within the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu Islands,
		 and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000 km (620 mi) away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions
		 to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.[47]

		Under Japanese law, Tokyo is designated as a to (都), translated as metropolis.[48] Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's
		 other prefectures. The 23 special wards (特別区, tokubetsu-ku), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, 
		 each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.

		In addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo also includes 26 more cities (市 -shi), five towns (町 -chō or machi), and eight villages (村 -son or -mura),
		 each of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers the whole metropolis including the 23 special wards and the cities and
		 towns that constitute the prefecture. It is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its headquarters is in Shinjuku Ward

		Culture And Attraction
		</h1>
		<p>
		
		Tokyo has many museums. In Ueno Park, there is the Tokyo National Museum, the country's largest museum and specializing in traditional
		Japanese art; the National Museum of Western Art and Ueno Zoo. Other museums include the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in
		Odaiba; the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, across the Sumida River from the center of Tokyo; the Nezu Museum in Aoyama; and the National Diet Library,
		National Archives, and the National Museum of Modern Art, which are near the Imperial Palace.

		Tokyo has many theaters for performing arts. These include national and private theaters for traditional forms of Japanese drama. Noteworthy
		are the National Noh Theatre for noh and the Kabuki-za for Kabuki.[110] Symphony orchestras and other musical organizations perform modern and 
		traditional music. The New National Theater Tokyo in Shibuya is the national center for the performing arts, including opera, ballet, contemporary
		dance and drama.[111] Tokyo also hosts modern Japanese and international pop, and rock music at venues ranging in size from intimate clubs to 
		internationally known areas such as the Nippon Budokan.


		The Sanja Festival in Asakusa
		Many different festivals occur throughout Tokyo. Major events include the Sannō at Hie Shrine, the Sanja at Asakusa Shrine, and the 
		biennial Kanda Festivals. The last features a parade with elaborately decorated floats and thousands of people. Annually on the last Saturday
		of July, an enormous fireworks display over the Sumida River attracts over a million viewers. Once cherry blossoms bloom in spring, many residents
		gather in Ueno Park, Inokashira Park, and the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden for picnics under the blossoms.

		Harajuku, a neighborhood in Shibuya, is known internationally for its youth style, fashion[112] and cosplay.

		Cuisine in Tokyo is internationally acclaimed. In November 2007, Michelin released their first guide for fine dining in Tokyo, awarding 191
		stars in total, or about twice as many as Tokyo's nearest competitor, Paris. As of 2017, 227 restaurants in Tokyo have been awarded (92 in Paris).
		Twelve establishments were awarded the maximum of three stars (Paris has 10), 54 received two stars, and 161 earned one star

		<figcaption align="center">Fig.6 - Takishata Strees.</figcaption>
		
		<p>
		As the largest population center in Japan and the site of the country's largest broadcasters and studios, Tokyo is frequently the setting for many 
		Japanese movies, television shows, animated series (anime), web comics, light novels, video games, and comic books (manga). In the kaiju 
		(monster movie) genre, landmarks of Tokyo are usually destroyed by giant monsters such as Godzilla and Gamera.

		Some Hollywood directors have turned to Tokyo as a backdrop for movies set in Japan. Postwar examples include Tokyo Joe, My Geisha, Tokyo Story
		 and the James Bond film You Only Live Twice; recent examples include Kill Bill, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Lost in Translation, Babel, 
		 Inception, The Wolverine and Avengers: Endgame.

		Japanese author Haruki Murakami has based some of his novels in Tokyo (including Norwegian Wood), and David Mitchell's first two novels number9dream 
		and Ghostwritten featured the city. Contemporary British painter Carl Randall spent 10 years living in Tokyo as an artist, creating a body of work 
		depicting the city's crowded streets and public spaces.
